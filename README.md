### Hey there! 😁:v:

I've been working as Full Stack Developer since 2018. I'm passionate about open source projects, coding in general and aways learn a lot about anything interesting.

In my free time I like to play games 🎮, to watch movies and series 📺, to read books 📚, to listen to music 🎵, and of corse talk with friends and drink a good beer 🍺.

Would you like to find me?
